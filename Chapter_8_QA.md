1. What is closely associated with residual risk? _**Residual risk is what an organization accepts after implementing controls to reduce risk, so is commonly associated with risk acceptance. An organization can avoid a risk by not providing a service or not participating in a risky activity**_
2. You need to calculate the ALE for a server. The value of the server is $3000, but has crashed 10 times in the past year. Each time it crashed, it resulted in a 10 percent loss. What's the ALE? _$3000_
3. You need to calculate the expected loss of an incident. Which of the following value combinations would you most likely use? _ALE and ARO_
4. You want to identify all of the services running on a server. What's a good choice to meet this goal? _Port scanner_
5. You recently completed a vulnerability scan on your network. It reported that several servers are missing key OS patches. However, after checking the servers, you've verified the servers have these patches installed. What best describes this? _False positive_
6. You suspect that a database server used by a web app doesn't have current patches. What is a good action to take to verify the server has up-to-date patches? _vulnerability scan_
7. You need to perform test on your network to identify missing security controls. However, you want to have the least impact on systems that users are accessing What tool is the best to meet this need? _vulnerability scan_
8. Lisa needs to identify if a risk exists on a web app and if attackers can potentially bypass security controls. However, she should not actively test the app. What's a good choice? _**A vulnerability scan identifies vulnerabilities that attackers can potentially exploit, and vulnerability scanners perform passive testing.**_
9. A recent vulnerability scan reported that a web app server is missing some patches. However, after inspecting the server, you realize that the patches are for a protocol that admins removed from the server. What's the best explanation for this disparity? _~~False negative~~ **A false positive on a vulnerability scan indicates that a vulnerability is positively detected, but the vulnerability doesn't actually exist. A false negaive indicates that the vulnerability scan did not detect a vulnerability that actually does exist on a system. False positibves can occur even if an organization has strong patch management process in place. Although it's true that the patch isn't applied, it's also true that the patch cannot be applied because it's for a protocol that admins removed.**_
10. Your organization develops web application software, which it sells to other companies for commercial use. Your organization wants to ensure that the software isn't susceptible to common vulnerabilities, such as buffer overflow attacks and race conditions. What should the organization implement to ensure software meets this standard? _Code review_
11. An organization has a legacy server within the DMZ. It is running older software that isn't compatible with current patches, so it remains unpatched. Management accepts the risk on this system, but wants to know if attackers can access the internal network if they successfully compromise this server. What's an appropriate test? _~~Vulnerability Scan~~ **A pentest attempts to compromise the server and then attempts to access the internal network. A vulnerability scann is passive; it doesn't attempt to compromise a system, so ti can't verify if an attacker can access the internal network**_
12. Testers don't have access to product documentation or any experience with an app. What type of test will they likely perform? _black box_
13. Your organization has hired a group of external testers to perform a black box pentest. One of the testers asks you to provide informaton about your internal network. What should you provide? _Nothing_
14. A network admin is troubleshooting a communication problem between a web server and a database server. What is a likely tool to be used in this scenario? _~~port scanner~~ **A protocol analyzer (or sniffer) is useful for capturing traffic between systems for analysis and is the best choice for this scenario. A port scanner identifies open ports in single systems, so it wouldn' be helpful here**_
15. A network admin needs to identify the type of traffic and packet flags used in traffic sent from a specific IP address. What's the best to meed this need? _protocol analyzer_
16. While analyzing a packet capture log, you notice the following entry:

        16:12:50, src 10.80.1.5.3389, dst 192.168.1.100:8080, syn/ack
    What best explains this entry? _An RDP connection attempt_
17. Security admins have recently implemented several security controls to enhance the network's security posture. Managment wants to ensure that these controls continue to function as intended. What's the best choice to meet this goal? _Routine audit_
18. Your organiazation recently hired an outside security auditor to review internal processes. The auditor identified several employees who had permissions for previously held jobs within the company. What should the organization implement to prevent this in the future? _User rights and permissions reviews_
19. Your organization's security policy states that admins should follow the principle of least privilege. What can ensure that admins are following the policy? _User rights and permissions review_
20. Your organization wants to ensure that security controls continue to function, helping to maintain an appropriate security posture. What's a good choice to meet the goal? _~~Routine audit~~ **Continuous security monitoring helps an organization maintain its security posture, by verifying that security controls continue to function as intended. Auditing logs, performing routine audits, and performing vulnerability scaxns are all part of a continuous monitoring plan. However, individually, they don't verify all security controls are operating properly**_
