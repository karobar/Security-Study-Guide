###### Tailgating 
Sneaking in behind somebody else who has access

---
###### Mantrap
 - highly  effective at preventing unauthorized entry
 - can prevvent tailgating.

---
###### Least Privilege
ensures users are granted only the access they need to perform their jobs, and no more.

---
##### RADIUS (Remote Authentication Dial-In User Service)
An AAA (Authentication, Authorization, and Accounting) protocol

###### 802.1x
 - An 802.1x server is implemented as a RADIUS server
 - An 802.1x server provides port-based authentication
 - can prevent unauthorized devices from connecting to a network
 - you can configure an 802.1x server with a VLAN to redirect unauthorized devices
 
---
###### TACACS+ 
Proprietary to Cisco

--- 
###### WPS (Wi-Fi Protected Setup)
 - a standard designed to simplify the setup of a wireless network
 - does not implement usernames

---
#### EAP-TTLS
 - an 802.1x solution

##### EAP (Extensible Authentication Protocol)

###### PEAP (Protected EAP)
requires a certificate

###### LEAP (Lightweight EAP)
weaksauce

##### TTLS (Tunneled Transport Layer Security)

--- 
###### PSK (WPA2-preshared key)
does not authenticate users based on their usernames

--- 
###### RDP (Remote Desktop Protocol)

---
###### Stateless Inspection
packet filtering

---
###### Yagi antennas
directioinal antennas

---
# IPS (Intrusion Prevention System)
###### NIPS (Network IPS)
 - installed on networks
 - can intercept malicious traffic coming into the network

###### HIPS (Host-Based IPS)

--- 
# UTM (Unified Threat Management)
###### URL filter
can block access to types of sites

###### Content/Malware inspection
don't block access to sites

---
# Encryption
###### TLS (Transport Layer Security)
- Secures transmissions for data in transit
- Doesn't have a default port, use the port based on what it's encrypting

###### SSL 
Doesn't have a default port, use the port based on what it's encrypting

###### FTPS (File Transfer Protocol Secure)
uses either SSL or TLS 

###### HTTPS
uses SSL or TLS

###### CCMP (Counter mode cipher block Chaining Message authentication code Protocol)
provides stronger encryption than TKIP

###### TKIP (Temporal Key Integrity Protocol)

###### WEP (Wired Equivalent Privacy)
 - outdated wireless encryption
 - weak IVs (initialization vectors) used for key transmission
 - uses the RC4 stream cipher (which is strong)

###### WPA & WPA2 (Wi-Fi Protected Access)
wireless encryption

---
# Address Translation

### Port Address Translation (PAT)
allows many internal devices to share one public IP

### Dynamic Network Address Translation (DNAT) 
uses multiple public IP addresses instead of just one

---
# DNS

###### AAAA Record
identifies IPv6 address of a given name.

###### A record
identifies IPv4 address of a given name. 

###### MX record
identifies a mail server

###### CNAME record
identifies aliases

# Controls

### Technical Controls

###### Disk encryption

### Preventative Controls
Attempt to prevent incidents

###### Cable locks

###### Hardening Systems
 - Makes them more secure than their default configuration, but doesn't protect data after device is lost
 - Disabling unnecessary services

### Management Controls

###### Risk assessment 

### Monitoring Controls

###### CCTVs

### Access Controls

##### ACLs - Access Control List
Generally take the following format:  
Permission | Protocol | Source | Destination | Port
--- | --- | --- | --- | ---
DENY or ALLOW| TCP/UDP/IP, occasionally ICMP |  IP addr (or range,subnet,ANY) | IP addr (or range,subnet,ANY)| 
  
 - rules implemented on routers & firewalls
 - basic packet filtering
      - IP addr (and subnet ID)
      - ports 
 - identify what traffic is allowed or denied
 - can allow incoming and/or outgoing traffic

###### Implicit Deny
 - Last rule in an ACL
 - Sometimes automatic, sometimes manual
 - May look like "Deny Any Any" or "Deny All All"

##### Proximity Card
 - won't prevent tailgating

##### Cipher Lock
 - door access control
 - won't prevent tailgating

#### Access control models

###### Mandatory Access Control (MAC)
 - uses sensitivity labels and classification levels
 - effective at restricting access on a need-to-know basis

###### Discretionary Access Control (DAC)
 - specifies that every object has an owner
 - assigns permissions based on object ownership
 - might identify owners in a list

###### Role-based access control (role-BAC)
 - uses group-based privileges

###### Rule-base access control (rule-BAC)
 - uses rules that trigger in response to events

---
# Sign-On

### Single Sign-On (SSO)
Users only have to log on once

###### SAML
used with web-based applications

### Same Sign-On
Users can access multiple systems using the same credentials, but they have to enter their credentials again each time they access a new resource.

# Authentication
Something you have | Something you are | Something you know 
---|---|---
|Hardware Tokens<br>Example: RSA tokens<br>uses a one-time password for authentication.| Biometrics | PIN 
|smart card|fingerprint|password|
||retina||

###### Do Not Require Hardware
 - PIN
 - password

###### Digital Signature
 - **non-repudiation**
 - integrity
