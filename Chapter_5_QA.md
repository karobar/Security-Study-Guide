1. Your organization wants to improve the security posture of internal datababase servers. What's the best solution? _Disabling unnecessary services_
2. You need to monitor the security posture of several servers in your organization and keep a security administrator aware of their status. What do? _Establishing baseline reporting_
3. You're compiling a list of approved software for desktop OSs within a company. What's the likely purpose of this list? _~~Baseline reporting~~ **A host software baseline (aka application baseline) identifies a list of approved sotware for systems and compares it with installed applications. Baseline reporting is a process that monitors systems for changes and reports discrepancies**_
4. Your organization wants to ensure that employees do not insstall or play OS games like Yukon solitaire and FreeCel. What do? _Application whitelisting_
5. An IT department recently had its hardware budget reduced, but the organization still expects them to maintain availability of services. What do? _Virtualization_
6. You're preparing to deploy a new applicion on a virtual server. The virtual server hosts another server application that employees routinely access.  What do? _Take a snapshot of the VM before deploying the new application_
7. A recent risk assessment identified several problems with servers in your organization. They occasionally reboot on their own and the operating systems do not have current security fixes. Admins have had to rebuild some servers from scratch due to mysterious problems. What do? _~~Sandboxing~~ **Patch managment procedures ensure that systems are kept up to date with current security fixes and patches and help eliminate problems with known attack methods. The scenario indicates that these systems have been attacked, exploidting the vulnerabilities caused by not patching them. Sandboxing isolates systems for testing but there isn't any indication that these servers should be isolated.**_
8. Admins ensure server OSs are updated at least once a month with relevant patches but they do not track other software updates. What's the best choice to mitigate risks on these servers? _Application patch management_
9. Homer noticed that several generators within the nuclear power plant have been turning on without user interaction. Security investigators discovered that an unauthorized file was installed and causing thse generators to start at timed intervals.  Further, they determined this file was installed during a visit by an external engineer. What do? _Configure the SCADA within a VLAN_
10. Your company has recently provided mobile devices to several employees. A security manager has expressed concerns related to data saved on these devices. What do? _???_
11. What's a likely negative result if admins don't implement access controls correctly on an encrypted USB hard drive? _**Disabling the use of mobile media on the devices will reduce the potential of data loss from these devices. It would make it more difficult to copy data to and from the devices**_
12. Your company provides electrical and plumbing services to homeowners. Employees use tablets during service calls to record activity, create invoices, and accept credit card payments. What's the best way to prevent disclosure of customer data if any of these devices are lost or stolen? _Remote wiping_
13. Key personnel in your organization have mobile devices which store sensitive information. What can you implement to prevent data loss in case a thief steals one? _Screen Lock_
14. Which of the following represents a primary security concern when authorizing mobile devices on a network? _Data security_
15. Your company is planning on implementing a policy for users so that they can connect their mobile devices to the network. However, management wants to restrict network access for these devices. They should have internet access and be able to access some internal servers, but management wants to ensure that they don't have access to the primary network where company-owned devices operate. What do? _VLAN_
16. Your organization hosts a web site with a back-end database. The database stores customer data, including credit card numbers. How to protect the credit card data? _Database column encryption_
17. Bart copied an encrypted file from his desktop to his USB drive and discovered that the copied file isn't encrypted. He asks you what he can do to ensure files he's encrypted remain encrypted when he copies them to a USB drive. What do? _**The best solution is to use whole disk encryption on the USB drive. The scenario indicates Bart is using file-level encryption (such as NTFS encryption) on the desktop computer, but the USB drive doesn't support it, possibly because it's formatted as a FAT32 drive. The result is that the system decrpyts the file before copying it to the USB drive**_
18. You are comparing different encryption methods. Which method includes a storage root key? _TPM_
19. Management wants to ensure that employees don't print any documents that include customer PII. What do? _DLP_
20. What's a cloud computing option that allows customers to apply patches to the operating system? _IaaS_
