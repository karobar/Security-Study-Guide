1. Give an example of a network tool which includes sniffing capabilities. _IDS_
2. A HIDS reported a vulnerability on a system using an assigned vulnerability identification number.  After researching the number on the vendor's web site, you identify the recommended solution and begin applying it. What type of HIDS is in use? _signature-based_
3. Management is concerned about malicious activity on your network and wants to implement a security control that will detect unusual traffic on the network. What's a good choice to meet this goal? _Anomaly-based IDS_
4. admins have noticed an increased workload recently. What can cause an increased workload from incorrect reporting? _False positives_
5. A security compnay wants to identify and learn about current and new attack methodologies. What's a good choice to meet this objective? _Honeypot_
6. What can you use to divert malicious attacks on your network away from valuable data to worthless fabricated data? _Honeypot_
7. Your network IDS recently detected an attack on a server.  Upon investigation, you discover that the IDS does not have a signature on this attack. Instead, the IDS detected it using a heuristic analysis. What's the most likely category of this attack? _Zero-day_
8. You needd to provide connectivity between two buildings without running any cables.  You decide to use two WAPs and a high-gain directional antenna. What's the best kind of antenna? _Yagi_
9. You are assisting a user in the implementation of a wireless network in his home. The wireless hardware he has requires the RC4 protocol. What type of security is best for this network? _~~WPA-AES~~ **TKIP uses RC4 and is compatible with older hardware so WPA-TKIP is the best option. WPA-AES is stronger, but uses AES instead of RC4**_
10. You want to implement the strongest level of security on a wireless network. What could support this goal? _Implementing WPA2_
11. You are planning to deploy a WLAN and you want to ensure it's secure. What provides the best security? _WPA2 CCMP_
12. Your organization is planning to implement a wireless network using WPA2 Enterprise. What's required? _An authentication server with a digital certificate installed_
13. You are assisting a small business owner in setting up a wireless hot spot for her customers. What's the most appropriate action for this hot spot? _Enabling Open System Authentication_
14. Homer is able to connect to his company's wireless network with his smartphone but not with his laptop. What's the most likely reason for this disparity? _His company's network has a MAC address filter in place_
15. Management asks you if you can modify the wireless network to prevent users from easily discovering it. What should you modify? _SSID broadcast_
16. A war driver is capturing traffic from a wireless network. When an authorized client connects, the attacker is able to implement a brute force attack to discover the encryption key. What kind of attack did the war driver use? _WPA cracking_
17. Your organization hosts three wireless networks for different purposes.  A recent site survey audit discovered the information below:

SSID | Security | Channel | Power
---|---|---|---
GetCertifiedVisitors|WPA2|1|71 dBm
GetCertifiedEmployee|WPA2|2|94 dBm
GetCertifiedEmployees|WPA2|3|73 dBm
GetCertifiedKiosk|WPA2|4|79 dB
What's going on here? _Rogue Access Point_

18. An attacker is able to access email contact lists on your smartphone. What happened? _Bluesnarfing_
19. Your organization is planning to implement a VPN and wants to ensure it's secure. What's a good protocol to use with the VPN? _IPsec_
20. An automated process isolated a computer in a restricted VLAN because the process noticed the computer's antivirus definitions were not up to date. What's the name of this process? _NAC_
