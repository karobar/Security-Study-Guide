What are the best items to include if website designers add this process? _Create a web-based form that verifies customer identities using another method and set a temporary password that expires upon first use_
4. Your organization is planning to implement stronger authentication for remote access users. An updated security policy mandates the use of token-based authentication with a password that changes every 30 seconds. What's the best choice to meet this requirement? _TOTP_
5. Your organization issues laptops to mobile users. Admins configured these laptops with FDE, which requires users to enter a password when they first turn on the computer. After the OS loads, users are required to log on with a username and password. What best describes this? _Single-factor authentication_
6. Users at your organization currently use a combination of smart cards and passwords, but an updated security policy requires multifactor security using 3 different factors. What can you add to meet the new requirement? _Fingerprint readers_

After investigation, he discovered that an authorized employee gave this person the cipher lock code. What's the best response to this issue at the minimum cost? _~~Place a guard at the entrance~~ **Securiy awareness training is often the best response to violations of security policies. If the individuals don't abide by the policies after training, management can take disciplinary action. Guards can prevent this issue by only allowing authorized personnel in based on facial recognition or identification badges. but at a much higher cost**_
12. Management recently rewrote the organization's security policy to strenghten passwords created by users. It now states that passwords should support special characters. What's the best setting to help the organization achieve this goal? _Complexity_
13. You've discovered that some users have been using the same passwords for months, even though the password policy requires users to change their password every 30 days. You want to ensure that users can't reuse the same password. Which settings should you configure? _~~Maximum password age~~ and minimum password age **The password history setting records previously used passwords to prevent users from reusing the same passwords. Using the password history setting combined with the minimum password age setting prevents users from changing their password repeatedly to get back to their original password. The maximum password age setting ensures users change their passwords regularly, but this is already set to 30 days in the scenario**_
14. A company recently hired you as a security admin. You notice that some former accounts used by temporary employees are currently enabled. What's the best response? _~~Set account expiration dates for all accounts when creating them~~ **Running a last logon script allows you to identify inactive accounts, such as accounts that haven't been logged on to in the last 30 days. Setting expiration dates for newly created accounts is a good step, but it doesn't address previously created accounts**_
15. An organization supports remote access, allowing user to work from home. However, management wants to ensure that personnel can't log on to work systems from home during weekends and holidays. What best supports this goal? _time-of-day restrictions_

What's the best solution? _~~Enable SNMP~~ **The best answer is to restrict traffic based on physical addresses. This is also known as MAC address filtering and is configured on a switch. SNMP monitors and manages network devices**_
24. An organization recently updated its security policy. A new requiement dictates a need to increase protection from rogue devices plugging into physical ports. What provides the best protection? _~~Disable unused ports~~ **IEEE 802.1x is a port-based authentication protocol and it requires systems to authentiate before they're granted access to the network. If an attacker plugged a rogue device into a physical port, the 802.1x server would block it from accessing the network. Disabling unused ports is a good practice, but it doesn't prevent an attacker from unplugging a system from a used port and plugging the rogue device into the port**_
25. What would admins typically place at the end of a firewall? _Implicit deny_
26. Your organization wants to protect its web server from cross-site scripting attacks. What provides the best protection? _~~IDS~~ **A WAF is an application-layer firewall designed specifically to protect web servers.

27. Management recently learned that several employees are using the company network to visit gambling and gaming web sites. They want to implement a security control to prevent this in the future. What would meet this need? _~~WAF~~ **A UTM device typically includes a URL filter and can block access to web sites, just as a proxy server can block access to web sites. A WAF protects a web server from incoming attacks**_
28. Which of the following protocols operates on Layer 7 of the OSI odel? _SCP_
29. What best describes a false negative? _An IDS doesn't detect a buffer overflow attack_

33. What type of encryption is used with WPA2 CCMP? _AES_
34. Admins in your organization are planning to implement a wireless network. Management has mandated that they use a RADIUS server and implement a secure wireless authentication method. What should they use? _~~WPA2-PSK~~ **Enterprise mode implements 802.1x as a RADIUS server and LEAP can secure the authentication channel. LEAP is a Cisco proprietary protocol, but other EAP variations can be used like PEAP, EAP-TLS, and EAP-TTLS WPA and WPA2 using a PSK don't use radius**_
35. Which of the following wireless security mechanisms is subject to a spoofing attack? _MAC address filtering_
36. What's the best description of why disabling SSID broadcast is not an effective security measure against attackers? _The network name is contained in wireless packets in plaintext_

65. A penetration tester is tasked with gaining info on one of your internal servers and he enters the following command `telnet server1 80`. What's the purpose of this command? _~~Use Telnet to remotely administer server1~~ **This command sends a query to server1 over port 80 and if the server is running a service on port 80, it will connect.
