3. A network admin configured several servers to work together to increase the processing capabilites for a web app. What does the admin likely implement? _Load balancing_
4. Your company's web site experiences a large number of client requests during certain times of the year. What could your company add to ensure the web site's availability during these times? _Load balancing_

What is a backup plan that would meet this need? _~~Full backups on Sunday and differential backups every other day of the week~~ **A full/incremental backup strategy is best with one full backup on one day and incremental backups on the other days. Differential backups become steadily larger as the week progresses and take more time to back up than incremental backups.**_
7. A business continuity expert is creating a BIA. What is an element which is likely to be omitted from the BIA? _Recommended solutions_
8. After a recent attack causing a data breach, an executive is analyzing the financial losses. She determined that the attack is likely to cost at least $1 million. She wants to ensure that this information is documented for future planning purposes. Where is she likely to document it? _BIA_
9. You are helping implement your company's BCP. For one system, the plan requires an RTO of five hours and an RPO of one day. What would meet this requirement? _Ensure the system can be restored within five hours and ensure it doesn't lose more than one day of data_
10. An organization is considering an alternate location as part of its BCP. It wants to identify a solution that provides the shortest recovery time. What will it choose? _hot site_
11. Your organization is working on its BCP. Management wants to ensure that documents provide detailed information on what technicians should do after an outage. Specifically, they want to list the systems to restore and the order in which to restore them. What document includes this information? _DRP_

What type of test is this? _~~Functional exercise~~ **A Tabletop exercise is discussion-based and is typically performed in a classroom or conference room setting. Because this is a meeting led by the BCP coordinator, it's a tabletop exercise. Functional exercises are hands-on exercises and include simulations and full-blown tests**_
15. Personnel within your organization turned off the HR data server for over six hours to perform a test. What's the most likely purpose for this? _COOP_
16. Humiditiy Controls in your data center are failing. You need to convince management of the importance of these. What would you tell them? _Failing humidity controls can cause damage from ESD and condensation_
17. Your organization is evaluating replacement HVAC systems and is considering increasing current capacities. What's a potential security benefit of increasing the HVAC capabilities? _Higher MTBF times of hardware components due to lower temperatures_
18. Without adequate physical security controls, attackers can cause significant damage to systems within a data center. What could an attacker manipulate to cause extensive physical damage? _Environmental controls_
19. An attacker was able to sneak into your building but was unable to open the server room door. He bashed the proximity badge reader with a portable fire extinguisher and the door opened. What's the most likely reason the door opened? _The access system was designed to fail-open_
